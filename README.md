# Financial Budget Analysis with Python

This project focuses on analyzing financial budget data using Python programming language. The dataset used for analysis is stored in a CSV file, and the analysis is performed using the Pandas and NumPy libraries. The output of the analysis includes data visualizations such as graphs and charts to illustrate how the budget is allocated across different departments or sectors.

## Overview

A financial budget is a detailed report on the income and expenditure of a government or organization for a specific financial year. Budget analysis involves examining and evaluating financial plans to determine their effectiveness and efficiency. It helps in identifying areas for improvement, making better financial decisions, and optimizing resource allocation.

## Project Steps

1. **Data Preparation:** Load the budget data from the CSV file into a Pandas DataFrame.
2. **Data Analysis:** Analyze the budget data to understand its structure, key assumptions, and objectives.
3. **Visualization:** Use Matplotlib or other plotting libraries to create visual representations of the budget data, such as bar charts, pie charts, or line graphs.
4. **Budget Performance Evaluation:** Compare budgeted values with actual performance data to identify variances or discrepancies.
5. **Recommendations:** Develop recommendations to address any budgetary issues or inefficiencies identified during the analysis process.

## Technologies Used

- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib (or other visualization libraries)

## How to Run

1. Download the repository and open on the VS Code.
2. Download the Csv file that is used as data set.
3. Run the main Python script to perform budget analysis and generate visualizations.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project is stored in a CSV file named `budget_data.csv`. It contains information about the income and expenditure of the government or organization for a specific financial year.
